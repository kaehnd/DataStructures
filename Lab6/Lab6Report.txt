Required Benchmarks:

grid3x3.txt words.txt ArrayListIndexed
Search found 67 words
Search runtime: 00:07.3023

grid4x4.txt words.txt LinkedListIterated
Search found 237 words
Search runtime: 00:25.7462

grid6x6.txt words.txt SortedArrayList
Search found 877 words
Search runtime: 01:47.3164


Performing these tests showed to what extent increasing the grid
size increased the runtime of the program. To gain a better sense
of how each strategy would affect the runtime, the word list was
changed to the 200words.txt and each strategy was tested with
the grid3x3.txt and grid4x4.text files using a batch command process. 

The results of these tests follow (note how each test finds the 
same number of words, verifying that the program's functionality
is indepenent of the data strucutre used):


grid3x3.txt 2000words.txt ArrayListIndexed
Search found 7 words
Search runtime: 104.5172 ms

grid3x3.txt 2000words.txt ArrayListIterated
Search found 7 words
Search runtime: 123.2673 ms

grid3x3.txt 2000words.txt LinkedListIndexed
Search found 7 words
Search runtime: 00:01.2547

grid3x3.txt 2000words.txt LinkedListIterated
Search found 7 words
Search runtime: 150.5751 ms

grid3x3.txt 2000words.txt SortedArrayList
Search found 7 words
Search runtime: 101.0396 ms


grid4x4.txt 2000words.txt ArrayListIndexed
Search found 29 words
Search runtime: 254.8882 ms

grid4x4.txt 2000words.txt ArrayListIterated
Search found 29 words
Search runtime: 219.9636 ms

grid4x4.txt 2000words.txt LinkedListIndexed
Search found 29 words
Search runtime: 00:03.5823

grid4x4.txt 2000words.txt LinkedListIterated
Search found 29 words
Search runtime: 219.1994 ms

grid4x4.txt 2000words.txt SortedArrayList
Search found 29 words
Search runtime: 188.5420 ms


Finally, each of the strategies were tested with a more 'pure'
increase of problem size with the grid3x3.text file, by increasing
the words list to the words.txt file and testing every strategy.
The LinkedListIndexed, as expected, took a very long time to run,
and its final results are not included


grid3x3.txt words.txt ArrayListIndexed
Search found 67 words
Search runtime: 00:07.2138

grid3x3.txt words.txt ArrayListIterated
Search found 67 words
Search runtime: 00:06.2440

grid3x3.txt words.txt LinkedListIndexed
*Progress indicators suggest that this would
take over three hours to run*

grid3x3.txt words.txt LinkedListIterated
Search found 67 words
Search runtime: 00:07.3411

grid3x3.txt words.txt SortedArrayList
Search found 67 words
Search runtime: 00:04.9546


As expected, the LinkedListIndexed strategy is, of course,
drastically slower than each of the other strategies due to
the inefficient nature of the .get(i) method for the 
LinkedList (O(n)). The SortedArrayList was faster and 
more efficient than any other strategy in all cases, but
especially with the larger problems rather than the smaller
problems. This may be because both the big O of the contains()
method of the SortedArrayList is much faster than that of any
of the other strategies, because of its use of a binary search.
Also, the amount of time that it takes to add all items in sorted order
ofsets its efficiency in smaller problems.
